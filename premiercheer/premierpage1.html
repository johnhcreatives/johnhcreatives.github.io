	<h2><b>Welcome</b></h2>

	<p>Premier Star Cheer and Tumble was established in 1998. Teaching cheer, dance and gymnastics around Leicestershire, we currently have over 350 children being taught each week with ages from 3 years old to adult and are Leicester's largest, most successful and longest running cheerleading squad.</p>
	
	<p>We are very excited to announce we now have our own cheer and tumble gym, with a 9-panel sprung cheer floor, tumble track, three air tracks and smaller 5-panel sprung floor area, where we hold all of our Leicester city classes.</p>
	
	<p>Our new gym is also open for hire, for birthday party's, events, classes and extra training sessions on a competition floor for other teams. Please contact us for more information and availability.</p>

	<p>All Premier Star teams perform at competitions, charity, corporate and fundraising events across the UK.</p>

	<p>Premier Stars hold numerous Regional, National and Grand Champion titles (the highest scoring team of the competition), and have competed in Europe and America where we came 2nd and 3rd in tough divisions, also receiving a bid to the Cheerleading Worlds in 2008.</p>
	
	<p>Premier Stars offer a highly experienced level of coaching and training in both cheerleading and tumble/gymnastics. We focus on athleticism, teamwork, commitment, self belief, confidence and most of all FUN.</p>
	
	<p>We have coaches trained by USASF, BGU and British Gymnastics and are always learning the latest techniques, drills and skills.</p>
